# Solving-Array-uniqueness-with-different-algorithms

The Selected algorithms that were used in this project were brute-force, Transform-and-conquer and dynamic programming.
We worked with python language and we used built-in data type called Dictionary and it is an example of hash table, so we used it in order to keep track of the visited elements like in the line s=dict() ,So we loop on the length of the array and ask if the element is not in the the dictionary variable (s) and if not we put
value in the dictionary and else we put value in array to know which value is not unique because of.
It doesn’t enter repeated values in the dictionary so if it is empty it is unique.
We created random numbers in the array with different random sizes each time for test cases as much as we can.It is working with numbers, letters and words.
if we want to conduct a comparison in different cases between the three used algorithms:
In the Best Case: among the algorithms the best one is the Dynamic Programming as it doesn’t use sort and it finds in the first 2 cells.
In the Average Case: among the algorithms the best one is Dynamic Programming.
In the Worst Case: among the algorithms the best one is Transform and conquer as it always sort the array.
